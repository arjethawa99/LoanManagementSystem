# LoanManagementSystem
A Java desktop application built using JavaSE(business logic), JavaFx(GUI), MySQL(backend database). The design pattern used is the infamous MVC(Model View Controller). This is, by no means, a serious attempt in building an actual loan management system. But it can serve as a nice starting point for understanding software development. It also makes one appreciate how big of a difference a good design pattern can make in the ease of developing an application. This  project was given to me by the course instructor as a part of the OOP course during my 4th semester of college
